<p>
  This are two calculator components that share the information with a service, you will see the display duplicated.
</p>
<div>
  <app-calc [calcData]="calcData1"></app-calc>
  <br>
  <app-calc [calcData]="calcData2"></app-calc>
</div>
<p>
  As seen here we can take the advantage of the components to simplify the coding and encapsulating
  the idea of the calculator component, we use the service to make the result available in other parts
  of the application, in the case that we don't need the information in different parts of the applications
  then we may avoid the use of the service and store all methods inside the component.
</p>
<p>
  For the application to work as a data driven page, we need to make sure that the data that we receive is
  compatible with the methods and the logic that we have in the frontend. For example, we receive the json
  with the methods but they won't work unless we define those methods here in the frontend.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  To make that example we use the same methods and the same data but we don't use the service.
  Instead we 'hardcode' it inside this landing page of the calculator route.
</p>
<app-calc2 [calcData]="calcData1"></app-calc2>
<br>
<app-calc2 [calcData]="calcData2"></app-calc2>
<p>
  It is recommended to use the service or the component alone (depending of the scope of the information that will be handled)
  to detach the logic of the component, when the data that we receive changes format
  then we wouldn't have to update the global UI, but the service or individual component instead.
